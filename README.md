# jat

`jat` is a clone of `treams` (see https://tfp-photonics.github.io/treams) with some added capabilities, but no guarantees.
In particular I have been working towards evaluation at complex valued frequencies. At some point these developments will be consolidated and merged back into `treams`.

## Installation

To install the package please clone the repo and run

```sh
pip install .
```

in the projects root directory.
